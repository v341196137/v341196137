# About Me

Hello! My name is Vivian Dai. I will say lots of seemingly out of context things like "‚òï = üç©" or "this quark has a strange flavor" but I swear I'm not insane and all these make sense :D

## Random Intro

<details>

<summary>If you're looking at this because of an application... please don't read this. If you're a friend stalking my Github, you're free to read this lol:</summary>

Have you heard of the [million monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) before? If you have a million monkeys who each spend a million years typing at a typewriter, somewhere, eventually, collectively, the entire works of Shakespeare will be typed out. In one of Janet Tashjian's works (I think this is right), it mentions the works of Shakespeare will not be the only thing that gets typed out. Somewhere along the way, several other important works will be typed out as well. However, most of the things the monkeys type is still giberish. This theorem is an accurate representation of how I work. I am but a mindless monkey who types things until things work. üêí

## Code

<summary>Here's some hopefully maybe cool coding related stuff I do:</summary>

Most of my projects are probably in either Java or Python. If you exclude that one repository containing my group's final comp sci project for school, Python is by far my most used language.

Thank you to [https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) for the cards.

### Hackathons

<details>

<summary>I think the right thing to say is "go check out my <a href="https://devpost.com/viviandai">Devpost</a>"</summary>

I guess I'll only list the hackathons where we won stuff:

[*YRHacks 2021*](https://yrhacks.devpost.com/): our team won the sustainabiity prize.

### Writeups

#### CTFs

<details>

<summary>I like *attempting* CTFs from time to time. The keyword here is definitely "attemping" since I'm not exactly great at them.</summary>

I plan to do more CTFs and only include major ones later.

[*PicoCTF 2021*](https://picoctf.org/competitions/2021-spring.html): our team ranked 353<sup>rd</sup> globally and 29<sup>th</sup> in Canada

[![PicoCTF 2021 writeup](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=vivian-dai&repo=picoCTF2021-Writeup&theme=tokyonight)](https://vivian-dai.github.io/PicoCTF2021-Writeup/)

[*Angstrom CTF 2021*](https://2021.angstromctf.com/): a 100% random CTF I attended. My team ranked 457<sup>th</sup>

</details>

#### Others

<details>

<summary>My non CTF writeups I thought might be worth a mention</summary>

I swear I'm 100% qualified to be making writeups on other things:

[*Over the Wire Bandit*](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) is a nice beginner level Wargame. I'm probably mostly using the [writeup](https://www.notion.so/Over-the-Wire-Bandit-d532f721481b4c298be2cb7a4db65514) to figure out how to use other tools

[CCC](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc) is the closest I'm ever going to get to competitive programming. I'll add more questions later.
