# About Me

Hello! My name is Vivian Dai. I will say lots of seemingly out of context things like "‚òï = üç©" or "this quark has a strange flavor" but I swear I'm not insane and all these make sense :D

## Random Intro

Have you heard of the [million monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) before? If you have a million monkeys who each spend a million years typing at a typewriter, somewhere, eventually, collectively, the entire works of Shakespeare will be typed out. In one of Janet Tashjian's works (I think this is right), it mentions the works of Shakespeare will not be the only thing that gets typed out. Somewhere along the way, several other important works will be typed out as well. However, most of the things the monkeys type is still giberish. This theorem is an accurate representation of how I work. I am but a mindless monkey who types things until things work. üêí

Most of my projects are probably in either Java or Python. You should uh ignore the fact my most used language stats say differently.
